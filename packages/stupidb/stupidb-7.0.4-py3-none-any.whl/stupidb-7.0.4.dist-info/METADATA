Pronounced in at least two ways:

1. Stoo-PID-eh-bee, rhymes with "stupidity"
2. Stoopid-DEE-BEE, like "stupid db"

Are you tired of software that's too smart? Try StupiDB, the stupidest database
you'll ever come across.

StupiDB was built to understand how a relational database might be implemented.

RDBMSs like PostgreSQL are extremely complex. It was hard for to me to imagine
what implementing the core of a relational database like PostgreSQL would look
like just by tinkering with and reading the source code, so I decided to write
my own.

## Features

- Stupid joins
- Idiotic window functions
- Woefully naive set operations
- Sophomoric group bys
- Dumb custom aggregates
- Scales down, to keep expectations low
- Wildly cloud unready
- Worst-in-class performance

## Non-Features

- Stupid simple in-memory format: `Iterable[Mapping[str, Any]]`
- Stupidly clean codebase
