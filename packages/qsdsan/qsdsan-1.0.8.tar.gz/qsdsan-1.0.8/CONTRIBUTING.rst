Contributing to ``QSDsan``
==========================

Below are some brief instructions on how to contribute to ``QSDsan``. If you have any questions regarding the process, feel free to `submit an issue on GitHub <https://github.com/QSD-Group/QSDsan/issues>`_. Thank you in advance for your contribution!

Authorship
----------
The following guideline is adapted from `BioSTEAM <https://biosteam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CONTRIBUTING.html#authorship>`_, we welcome inputs from the community for enhancement. If you feel that your contributions are not acknowledged or adequately acknowledged, please do contact us.

#. Contributions must be acknowledged at the module-level with a short description for:

	- Code development. The primary author is encouraged (but not required) to include contact info in the module.
	- Module development (i.e., math algorithms, codes in other languages).
	- Instrumental comments and suggestions through discussion.

#. All contributors will be added to the `author list <https://qsdsan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/AUTHORS.html>`_.

#. If any code or implementation was copied from a third party, it should be noted in the module-level documentation.

#. Any third-party packages copied from ``QSDsan`` must be strictly open-source (not copy-left nor open-access). If license of the third-part package is different from ``QSDsan``, the module should add the third-party license as an option (i.e., dual licensing).


Forking and Cloning
-------------------
#. Fork ``QSDsan`` by going to its `GitHub homepage <https://github.com/QSD-Group/QSDsan>`_ and click the "Fork" button at the top right corner.

#. Copy the link to **your** fork of ``QSDsan`` (you can find it in the green "Code" button on your forked GitHub ``QSDsan`` page), it should be something like:

	.. code:: bash

	    https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/QSDsan.git


#. In your command-line interface (e.g., Anaconda prompt, terminal), navigate to your preferred location by using ``cd``, e.g.,

	.. code:: bash

	    cd research/coding


#. Clone ``QSDsan`` to your local by (use your own link copied from step 2):

	.. code:: bash

	    git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/QSDsan.git --depth=1

	- If you don't have ``git``, follow the `instructions <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>`_ to install it.
	- The ``--depth-1`` flag is to tell ``git`` just clone the latest commit, you can change the depth number or just remove this flag completely, but then ``git`` will download more historical commits, which takes longer time to clone and needs more space.

	.. note::
	 	
	 	This will only clone the main branch, if you want other branches, then use the ``no-single-branch`` flag, i.e.

		.. code:: bash

		    git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/QSDsan.git --depth=1 --no-single-branch

#. Navigate into the cloned QSDsan:

	.. code:: bash

	    cd QSDsan

#. Install required packages:

	.. code:: bash

	    pip install â€“r requirements_dev.txt


#. Add the root ``QSDsan`` as the upstream:

	.. code:: bash

	    git remote add upstream https://github.com/QSD-Group/QSDsan.git

#. Check your remote settings:

	.. code:: bash

	    git remote -v

	- This should show something like (origin is your fork and upstream is the root repository):

	.. code:: bash

		origin	https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/QSDsan.git (fetch)
		origin	https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/QSDsan.git (push)
		upstream	https://github.com/QSD-Group/QSDsan.git (fetch)
		upstream	https://github.com/QSD-Group/QSDsan.git (push)

#. Pull in upstream changes:

	.. code:: bash

	    git pull upstream main

#. If you are working on a new feature (rather than some quick work like fixing a small bug), then it is recommended to checkout a new branch:

	.. code:: bash

	    git checkout -b REPLACE-ME-WITH-FEATURE-NAME


Note
^^^^
#. We use fork as the default way for collaboration (i.e., for all first-time contributors). If you are a constant contributor and have independently made at least one successful and meaningful contribution through forking, you will be given the write access to ``QSDsan`` and you can use branch for easier code syncing. We will also jinvite you to join the ``QSDsan`` team.
#. GitHub has really detailed documentation on `forking <https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo>`_ (and almost everything else).
#. If you are new to command-line interface, `GitHub Desktop <https://desktop.github.com/>`_ is recommended.


Developing Modules
------------------
#. Adding/modifying modules locally.

#. `Commit <https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit>`_ your changes and concisely summarize your changes in the commit message.

	- You can have multiple `branches <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging>`_ for different features.

#. Push your local changes to your remote fork:

	.. code:: bash

	    git push origin main # or the name of the new branch

	- As your develop your contributions, the root repository may update, you should merge these changes and resolve any conflicts before your final push.

	.. code:: bash

	    git pull upstream main


Submitting Pull Request
-----------------------
#. Once you are satisfied with your changes and push all commits to your fork, go to you GitHub fork of ``QSDsan``, and submit a `pull request <https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request>`_.

	- You can confirm that you have pulled all updates from the root repository if there's a message showing that your branch is X commits ahead of QSD-Group:main (not X commits ahead, Y commits behind).

#. One of the Quantitative Sustainable Design Group members will review your changes and accept or discuss with you if edits are needed.


Documentation
-------------
Whenever new modules or functions are added, concise and thorough documents should be added with examples for `doctest`_. Please also include yourself (contact method is optional) to the list of contributors on the top of the module.

``QSDsan`` uses `numpydoc docstring style <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html>`_ with some modifications for better rendering. Some important notes:

- Both quotes ('') and double quotes ("") are good.
- If you want some notes in your docstring, use `directives <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/directives.html>`_ so that it can be rendered by `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_.
	
	.. code::

		# This can be rendered by Sphinx and as docstring
		.. note::

			Something to notes.

			[1] If you need to have a numbered list, be careful about line-wrapping and indentation.
			The start of the second line should align with the number, not the first character after the number. 

			[2] Second point.

		# This won't be rendered by Sphinx
		Notes
		-----

		# This can be rendered by Sphinx but won't be recognized as docstring
		Note
		----

- Use directives like ``:class:`package.class``` and ``:func:`class.function``` to indicate classes and functions, this will automatically add links to the corresponding documents.

	- Use single back ticks (``) in error messages and warnings since directives won't be rendered.

- If you want to refer to documents of other internal modules or external packages, please include it in the "See Also" section (refer to :class:`qsdsan.sanunits.AnaerobicDigestion` and :class:`qsdsan.Component` as examples).
- Here is a great `memo on reStructuredText and Sphinx <https://rest-sphinx-memo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.


Most of the documentations will be automatically generated through `Sphinx's autodoc extension <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html>`_. If your contribution involves new classes or modules, please add a new .rst file in docs/source/. and add it to the appropriate section in the ``index.rst`` file. You can refer to any of the existing files for examples.

Tutorials are prepared in `Jupyter Notebook <https://jupyter.org/>`_ and potential contributors are encouraged to use the `templates <https://github.com/QSD-Group/QSDsan/tree/main/docs/source/for_developers>`_ which includes proper license and contribution information.


Testing
-------
``QSDsan`` uses `AppVeyor <https://www.appveyor.com/>`_ to test all pushes and pull requests. A pull request will only be accepted when:

#. Meaningful contributions have been made.
#. The branch has no conflicts with the root repository.
#. All tests have been passed.

You can run the test locally using `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/>`_:

	.. code:: bash

	    python3 -m pytest

This runs all tests under the QSDsan/tests directory as well as all examples in the documentation through `doctest`_. Test results will be similar to the screenshot below, where a green dot indicates the test has been successfully passed and a red F indicates a failure. The number of dots and Fs indicate how many test functions or doctests are run for each moduel. Detailed error traceback on each failed test will be listed to help you fix the bug.
