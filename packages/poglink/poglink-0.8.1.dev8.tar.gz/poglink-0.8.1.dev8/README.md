[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/FM-17/poglink/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=Y84IU5NAH0)](https://codecov.io/gh/FM-17/poglink)

Poglink is a locally-hosted bot that monitors the ARK Web API and posts any changes to Discord. It was initially developed for use in the official [ARK: Survival Evolved Discord server](https://discord.gg/playark), but is open for anyone to use. 

## Server Rates Notifications
![image](https://i.ibb.co/2t9gR5K/poglink.png)

ARK's server rates are updated via [dynamic config URLs](https://arkdedicated.com/dynamicconfig.ini). When provided with these URLs, Poglink will automatically notify your Discord of any changes to the server rates.

Recently updated rates will be shown in **bold**, and the embed title will be automatically adjusted to indicate the game mode. If Poglink is set up in an [announcement channel](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032008192-Announcement-Channels-), it will publish its messages so you don't have to.
