# opentele
A **python** library created to make life easier for **Telegram API Developers**.\
[**Read the documentation**](https://opentele.readthedocs.io/en/latest/documentation/telegram-desktop/tdesktop/)

## Main Features
- Convert [Telegram Desktop](https://github.com/telegramdesktop/tdesktop) **tdata** sessions to [telethon](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon) sessions and vice versa.
- Use [telethon](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon) with [official APIs](#authorization) to avoid unnecessary problems.
- Randomize `device info` using real data that recognized by Telegram server.

## Dependencies

- [telethon](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon) - Widely used Telegram's API library for Python.
- [tgcrypto](https://github.com/pyrogram/tgcrypto) - AES-256-IGE encryption to works with `tdata`.
- [pyQt5](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/) - Used by Telegram Desktop to streams data from files.

## Installation
- Install from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/opentele/):
```pip title="pip"
pip install --upgrade opentele
```

## First Run
- Load TDesktop from tdata folder and convert it to telethon, with a custom API.
```python
from opentele.td import TDesktop
from opentele.tl import TelegramClient
from opentele.api import API, CreateNewSession, UseCurrentSession

async def main():

    # Load TDesktop client from tdata folder
    tdataFolder = "Path\\To\\tdata"
    tdesktop = TDesktop(tdataFolder)

    # Using official iOS API with randomly generated device info
    # print(api) to see more
    api = API.TelegramIOS.Generate()

    # Convert TDesktop session to telethon client
    # CreateNewSession flag will use the current existing session to
    # authorize the new client by `Login via QR code`.
    client = await tdesktop.ToTelethon("newSession.session", CreateNewSession, api)

    # Although Telegram Desktop doesn't let you authorize other
    # sessions via QR Code (or it doesn't have that feature),
    # it is still available across all platforms (APIs).

    # Connect and print all logged in devices
    await client.connect()
    await client.PrintSessions()

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Authorization
**opentele** offers the ability to use **official APIs**, which are used by official apps. You can check that out [here](https://github.com/thedemons/opentele/blob/main/docs/content/documentation/authorization/api.md#api).
<br>
According to [Telegram TOS](https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id#using-the-api-id): *all accounts that sign up or log in using unofficial Telegram API clients are automatically put under observation to avoid violations of the Terms of Service*.
<br>
<br>
It also uses the **[lang_pack](https://core.telegram.org/method/initConnection)** parameter, of which [telethon can't use](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/blob/master/telethon/client/telegrambaseclient.py#L375) because it's for official apps only.
<br>
Therefore, **there are no differences** between using opentele and official apps, the server can't tell you apart.

## Incoming Features
- [x] Writing data to tdata for converting telethon sessions to tdesktop.
- [x] Random device information for [initConnection](https://core.telegram.org/method/initConnection) to avoid spam-detection.
- [ ] Add support for [pyrogram](https://github.com/pyrogram/pyrogram).
