Description: # Flyover
        
        Fly your plane and shoot down as many enemy planes as possible!
        A simple pygame game implementing a 2D scrolling map.
        
        Created to explore scrolling maps, and Class inheritance. The shell of a game is complete and there's lots of room for improvement.

        ## Installation
        - Download the code
        - pip install pygame

        ## Controls
        - Arrow keys to turn, speed up/slow down
        - Space to shoot
        
        ## Features
        - Tiled map (entities bounce off the map edge)
        - Player plane centred in screen
        - Enemy planes with basic AI
        - Sound effects

        ## Ideas for more features
        - Player health (not a 1 hit kill system)
        - High score system
        - Different turning speeds for different plane speeds
        - Limited fuel and ammo, restock at a base
        - Background music
        - Mini map
        - Static defences with homing missiles
