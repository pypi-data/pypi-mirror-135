    """Segment a stack of 2d grain slices into 3d grains by orientation and z-overlap.

    This function iterates over stacks for pixelated grain masks and corresponding Id11
    grain objects to create a numpy 3d volume where each voxel has a uniqe integer number
    corresponding to the grain index. Void regions are set to 0. The index at a voxel
    corresponds to a Id11 grain object in an output dictionary of Id11 grains.

    Grains are considered to be one and the same if and only if:
        #1: They have at least one overlaping voxel in z.
        #2: They have orientation matrices resutling in a smaller angular deviation (dgrs)
            than angthres. This number represents the sum of angular devation at each
            orientation vector formed by taking the arccos of the three scalar products.
            
    Args:
        pixelated_grains (:obj:`list` of :obj:`lists` of :obj:`numpy arrays`): Pixelated masks of the grains
        id11_grains (:obj:`list` of :obj:`lists` of :obj:`ImageD11 Grain`): ImageD11 grain representations
            corresponding to the masks in pixelated_grains.
        angthres (:obj:`float`): Criteria threshold for mapping grains across z. Defaults to 3.0.
    
    Returns:
        sample (:obj:`numpy array`): Voxelated representation of full sample. the value at sample[i,j,k]
        is ```0``` if void and otherwise equal to the index of the grain in ```grains``` 
        grains (:obj:`dict` of :obj:`dict` of :obj:`ImageD11 Grain`): ImageD11 grain representations
            corresponding to ```sample``` index values such that grains["3"]["7"] gives the 7th slice if grain
            with index 3 in ```sample```.
