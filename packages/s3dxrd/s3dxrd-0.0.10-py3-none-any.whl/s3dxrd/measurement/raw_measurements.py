    Performs diffraction peak mapping and grain topology reconstruction
    working of ImageD11 file formats. These files are already proccessed in
    the sense that the grains have been indexed and detector tilt has
    been calibrated for etc. In scanning-3DXRD each layer (x-y) is scanned
    independently of z translations. Thus the input is a stacks of
    measurements, one file per sample z-translation. The coordinate system
    and experimental setup is described in:

    Attributes:
        zpos (:obj:`list` of :obj:`float`): Sample z-translations corresponding to grain_slices
            indices and peak_stack indices.
        grain_slices (:obj:`list` of :obj:`lists` of :obj:`grain`): Loaded ImageD11 grain '.map'
            or '.ubi' files. Each z-translation has a list of grains present in
            the slice. The map files are loaded via the ImageD11 grain module.
        peak_stack (:obj:`list` of :obj:`columnfile`): Loaded ImageD11 peak files. Each
            instance of the peak stack list contains a columnfile describing
            diffraction peaks originating from correpsonding z-translation. The 
            peak files are loaded via the ImageD11 columnfile module.
        params (:obj:`parameters`): Loaded ImageD11 parameter file. This object
            gives access to meta parameters of the experiment, such as detector tilt,
            sample to detector distance, and crystal cell parameters. The parameter
            file is loaded via the ImageD11 parameters module.
        omegastep (:obj:`float`): Rotation stage readout intervall in degrees. Each recorded
            frame in the experiment is was integrated over this intervall.
        ystep (:obj:`float`): y-translation stepsize between measurements. Normally the same
            as the beamsize.
        number_y_scans (:obj:`float`): The number of scanned y-positions made in each z-layer.
        ymin (:obj:`float`): Minium y-coordinate seen by the detector. These values differ from
            what is in the orginal columnfile in the case when the columnfile do not have
            a symmetric scanning intervall over y=0.
        ymax (:obj:`float`): Maximum y-coordinate seen by the detector. These values differ from
            what is in the orginal columnfile in the case when the columnfile do not have
            a symmetric scanning intervall over y=0.
        grain_topology_mask (:obj:`list` of :obj:`lists` of :obj:`numpy arrays`): Grain topology in binarized form.
            Each instance of the list contains all grain shapes at the corresponding z-slice, s.t  
            ```grain_topology_mask[i][j]``` gives the 2d numpy binarized array that corresponds to grain number 
            j in z-slice number i.
