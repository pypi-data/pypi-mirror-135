        exit   : is a 3 by N array of the coordinates where the ray leaves the sample (each col is x, y,z)

        kappa  : is a 3 by N array that defines the direction of strain measured (each col is a unit vector)
        L      : is a 1 by N array of the total irradiated lengths of each ray (ie distance between entry and exit)
