The environment is designed to leverage reinforcement learning methods into soft-robotics control.
Our inspiration is from slender-body living creatures, such as octopus or snake.
The code is based on [PyElastica](https://github.com/GazzolaLab/PyElastica), an open-source physics simulation for slender structure.
We intend this package to be easy-to-install and fully compatible to [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym).

> The package is under development, in Pre-Alpha phase. We are planning to complete the initial set of environment by the end of January 2022.

Requirements:
- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI Gym 0.21.0
- PyElastica 0.2+
- Matplotlib (optional for display rendering and plotting)	
- POVray (optional for 3D rendering)

## Installation

```bash
pip install gym-softrobot
```

To test the installation, you can run couple steps of the environment as the following.
```py
import gym 
import gym_softrobot
env = gym.make('OctoFlat-v0', policy_mode='centralized')

# env is created, now we can use it: 
for episode in range(2): 
    observation = env.reset()
    for step in range(50):
        action = env.action_space.sample() 
        observation, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
        print(f"{episode=:2} |{step=:2}, {reward=}, {done=}")
        if done:
            break
```

We use [POVray](https://wiki.povray.org/content/HowTo:Install_POV) python wrapper [Vapory](https://github.com/Zulko/vapory) to visualize the motion in 3D.
POVray is not a requirement to run the environment, but it is necessary to use `env.render()` function as typical gym environment.

## Reinforcement Learning Example

We tested the environment using [Stable Baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3) for centralized control.
More advanced algorithms are still under development.

If you have your own algorithm that you would like to test out, you are welcome to reach out to us.
