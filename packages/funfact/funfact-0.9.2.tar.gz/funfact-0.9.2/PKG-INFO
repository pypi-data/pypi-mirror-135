[FunFact](https://github.com/yhtang/FunFact.git) is a Python package that
enables flexible and concise expressions of tensor algebra through an Einstein
notation-based syntax. A particular emphasis is on automating the design of
matrix and tensor factorization models.  Itâ€™s areas of applications include
quantum circuit synthesis, tensor decomposition, and neural network
compression. It is GPU- and parallelization-ready thanks to modern numerical
linear algebra backends such as JAX/TensorFlow and PyTorch.


**This package is currently under active developments! Please check back in Jan 2022.**
