# color4console
color4console enables you to print colorful text without wasting time experimenting with various color combinations. It comes with a predefined color scheme. The color of the text is determined by the chosen theme.
This package's goal is to keep things as simple as possible. When the color of a text line is red, for example, bolding, underlining, or highlighting it is not essential. In the same way, if a text line is underlined, it may not be necessary to color it.

# Installation

```
pip install color4console

```

# Pre defined themes:
You can chose any of the following theme. Text color will automatically set based on your selected theme. 
```

# Color Supported Functions:

# Other Functions:
