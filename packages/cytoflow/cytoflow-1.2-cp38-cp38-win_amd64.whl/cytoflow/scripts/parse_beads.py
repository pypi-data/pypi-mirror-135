cytoflow.scripts.parse_beads
----------------------------

Parse beads.csv into a dict to go in cytoflow.operations.bead_calibration.
(As new beads are added, please add them to cytoflow/operations/beads.csv, then
run this and put the result in `cytoflow.operations.bead_calibration`)

# format of the input file is CSV
# first line, first col: name
# second line, first col: URL of the source spreadsheet
# following lines: first col is calibrant, remaining cols are values
# ...until a blank line
