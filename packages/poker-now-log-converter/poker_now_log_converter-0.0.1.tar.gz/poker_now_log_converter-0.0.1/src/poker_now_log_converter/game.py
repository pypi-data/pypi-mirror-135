class Game:
    """ A class representing a game of poker, which is comprised of many hands of poker.

    The Game class is initialised using a list of strings which comprise a PokerNow log. The initialiser reads the
    log line by line, creating Hand objects for each hand in the log, which are stored in a list of hands.

    Once the game object is initialised, the hero name or aliases can be set, which propagates to each hand in the list.

    Finally, the game can be output in the desired format (currently only PokerStars format) using the
    format_as_pokerstars_log() function.

    Attributes:
        self.hand_list (List[Hand]): The list of hands that happened during this game.
        self.currency (str): The currency used during this game. (e.g GBP)
        self.currency_symbol (str): The currency symbol used during this game. (e.g Â£)
        self.timezone (str): The timezone of this game (e.g GMT)
        self.original_file_path (str): If this game was constructed using a log file, this contains the path.
        self.seen_players (Set[Player]): The set of players observed in all of the hands in this game. It is
                                         calculated after all hands have been constructed.
