# MooCoderPy
Python/Tkinter version of Moocoder

Still a bit rough around the edges, but actually functional as a Moo Coding tool

Can be installed via pip:
* pip install moocoderpy-rjmatthews62
* python -m MooCoderPy

Setup -> Server Config : set server address (and port) 

File -> Connect - Connect to server
File -> Disconnect - Disconnect from server
File -> Open - Open a local file in the editor

External Editor support:

If you set @edit-option local+ on your MOO server, the @edit command will be redirected to MooCoderPy's internal editor.
Selecting Edit->Send Update (or F5) will issue the correct command to update whatever you are currently editing.

Project->New Tab (Ctrl+N) - Loads a verb into its own tab. Press F5 to compile.
Project->Get Verbs - Load all the verbs for an object into the verbs window.
    You can double click in the Verbs pane to edit that verb.

Basic error checking and stack trace implemented.

Command History is supported using the up and down arrow keys
