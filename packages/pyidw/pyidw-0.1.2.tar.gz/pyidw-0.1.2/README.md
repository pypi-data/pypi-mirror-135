# All in one IDW package for python
> **This is an example map created using pyidw library.**![idw interpolated map using pyidw](https://github.com/yahyatamim/pyidw/blob/master/images/output_map.png?raw=true)

## Features
 1. Simple IDW
 2. IDW with external raster (eg, elevation raster) covariable.
 3. Accuracy Score.
 4. Builtin raster visualisation with co-ordinate and colour bar.

## Why pyidw ?

Inverse distance weighted interpolation is one of the simplest geospatial interpolations available in GIS. Although it is easy to produce an idw raster using conventional desktop GIS software (eg. ArcGIS, QGIS). It was never straightforward to create such a beautiful map image using python. This is why I have created the pyidw library where you can create beautiful idw maps of your desired location using your favourite programming language üêç

pyidw also incorporates a clever technique to use additional raster data as a covariable using simple linear regression. For example, if you are working with temperature data, it is widely known that temperature is inversely proportional to elevation, the higher the elevation, the lower the temperature is. With pyidw, you can easily add elevation data with traditional idw calculation and improve your interpolation accuracy.
