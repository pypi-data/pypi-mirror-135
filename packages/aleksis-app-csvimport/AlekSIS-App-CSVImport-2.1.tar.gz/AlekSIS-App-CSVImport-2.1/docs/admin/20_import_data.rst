Importing data
==============

You can find the import form under `Admin → Data management → CSV import`.
Please be sure to select a matching school term (especially when importing
groups). Then select the file you want to import and a matching import
template.

.. warning::
   Please double-check if the combination of file, template, and school term
   is correct; otherwise, existing data may be corrupted!

To start the actual import, press the button `Import data`. Now you should
see a progress bar with the current import status and all errors that may occur.
