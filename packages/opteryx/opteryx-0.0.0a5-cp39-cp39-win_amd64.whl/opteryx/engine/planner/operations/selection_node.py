"""
Selection Node

This is a SQL Query Execution Plan Node.

This Node eliminates elminiates records which do not match a predicate using a
DNF (Disjunctive Normal Form) interpretter. 

Predicates in the same list are joined with an AND (all must be True) and predicates
in adjacent lists are joined with an OR (any can be True). This allows for non-trivial
filters to be written with just tuples and lists.

The predicates are in _tuples_ in the form (`key`, `op`, `value`) where the `key`
is the value looked up from the record, the `op` is the operator and the `value`
is a literal.
