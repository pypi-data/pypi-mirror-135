``BrainModels`` provides standard and canonical brain models (including various neurons, synapses, networks, and intuitive paper examples) which are implemented with [BrainPy](https://brainpy.readthedocs.io/) simulator. Moreover, we welcome your brain model implementations, and publish them through our [GitHub](https://github.com/PKU-NIP-Lab/BrainModels) homepage. In such a way, once your new model is implemented, it can be easily shared with other BrainPy users.



Currently, we provide the following standard models:


| Neuron Models                        | Synapse Models                 | Learning Rules |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | -------------- |
| Leaky integrate-and-fire model       | Alpha Synapse                  | STDP           |
| Exponential integrate-and-fire model | AMPA / NMDA                    | BCM rule       |
| Quadratic integrate-and-fire         | GABAA / GABAB                  | Oja\'s rule    |
| Adaptive Exponential IF model        | Exponential Decay Synapse      |                |
| Adaptive Quadratic IF model          | Difference of Two Exponentials |                |
| Generalized IF model                 | Short-term plasticity          |                |
