Description: Contains most recent poverty scale in poverty.yml
        
        When you include this in your package, you will have 4 variables
        available in the main Docassemble namespace:
        
        * poverty_level_update (year of update as a string)
        * poverty_base (base amount of poverty scale)
        * poverty_increment (amount for each additional household member)
        *  poverty_multiplier # threshold multiplier for Massachusetts Courts, 1.25
        
        To use: 
        
        ```
        ---
        include:
          - docassemble.MAPovertyScale:poverty.yml
        ---
        reconsider: True
        code: |
          additional_income_allowed = household_size * poverty_increment
          household_income_limit = (poverty_base + additional_income_allowed) * poverty_multiplier
        
          household_income_qualifies = int((household_income_limit)/12) >=  int(household_monthly_income)
        ```
