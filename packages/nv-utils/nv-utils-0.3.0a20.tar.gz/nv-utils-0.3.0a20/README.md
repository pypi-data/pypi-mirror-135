# nv.utils
Parsers, formatters, data structures and other helpers for Python 3. This is a source of recurring
portions of reusable code that we needed in our applications, such as tools for configuration parsing,
value casting, data structures, etc.

## What's inside?
[to come]


## Important message on Python for v0.2 and Python < 3.9
Substantial changes have been made on the organization of nv-utils for the long run, with breaking changes vs. 0.1.15.

## Disclaimers
THIS IS UNDOCUMENTED WORK IN PROGRESS. READ THE LICENSE AND USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.

THIS IS STILL A BETA AND BREAKING CHANGES MAY (AND PROBABLY WILL) OCCUR UNTIL ITS CONTENT STABILIZES. WE
ARE ACTIVELY MIGRATING STUFF OUT OF THIS LIBRARY (AND LOOKING FOR SUBSTITUTES THAT ARE MORE ACTIVELY MAINTAINED)
