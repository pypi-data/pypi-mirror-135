class NotificationWebsocket:
    """
    This class allows you to receive notifications without constantly polling the server.
    To utilize it you should do either of:
        - Make a class inheriting this one and redefine the event functions (logout, new, ...).
        - Use the event function as a decorator, read more on its use under its docs.

    **Init Parameters**

    notification_url: :class:`str`
        url endpoint to connect to. Can obtain one via get_notifications

    auth: :class:`AuthHandler`
        The same auth handler used for Client

    **Event types**

    logout
        Server will disconnect session after sending this event so don't try to reconnect.

    new
        New notification. See :class:`Notification` object for notification types.

    read
        Notification has been read.

    unplanned_disconnect
        Event fired by NotificationWebsocket object when connection without having been sent a logout event.
        Default function fires connect to try and reconnect.
