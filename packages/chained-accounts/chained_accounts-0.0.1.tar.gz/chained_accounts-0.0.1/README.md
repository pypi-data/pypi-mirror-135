# Chained Accounts

![Continuous Integration](https://github.com/tellor-io/pytelliot/actions/workflows/py39.yml/badge.svg)

A thin framework to help applications and users manage multiple ethereum accounts on multiple chains.

*Motivation*

Blockchain applications are becoming more cross-chain and multi-chain, therefore having a need to manage multiple user
accounts on different chains. Users need an easy way to configure an application to use their private keys, including
specifying which EVM chains they can be used on. Applications also need easy access to user private keys while providing
a way to handle them securely, rather than storing them in plain text.

*Overview*

Each `ChainedAccount`:

- has a user-friendly name
- can be associated with one or more EVM chains.
- is encrypted in a local keystore using the [`eth_keyfile`](https://github.com/ethereum/eth-keyfile) package.

Applications can easily access the keystore and search for accounts by name, EVM chain, and address.

Note: This package does not directly perform any encryption/decryption, but relies on the
https://github.com/ethereum/eth-account package.

** USE AT YOUR OWN RISK **

## Installation

    pip install chained_accounts

## Examples

Create an account for use on either Ethereum Mainnet or Rinkeby testnet.

### Python

```python
from chained_accounts import ChainedAccount, find_accounts

key1 = "0x57fe7105302229455bcfd58a8b531b532d7a2bb3b50e1026afa455cd332bf706"
ChainedAccount.add("my-eth-acct", [1, 4], key1, password="foo")

acc = find_accounts(chain_id=1)[0]
print(f"Address: {acc.address}")
print(f"Chains: {acc.chains}")

acc.unlock("foo")
print(f"Private key: {acc.key.hex()}")
```

```pycon
ChainedAccount('my-eth-acct')
Address: 0xcd19cf65af3a3aea1f44a7cb0257fc7455f245f0
Chains: [1, 4]
Private key: 0x57fe7105302229455bcfd58a8b531b532d7a2bb3b50e1026afa455cd332bf706
```
### Command Line

    >> chained add my-eth-acct 0x57fe7105302229455bcfd58a8b531b532d7a2bb3b50e1026afa455cd332bf706 1 4
    Enter encryption password for my-eth-acct: 
    Confirm password:
    Added new account my-eth-acct (address= 0xcd19cf65af3a3aea1f44a7cb0257fc7455f245f0) for use on chains (1, 4)
    >> chained find
    Found 1 accounts.
    Account name: my-eth-acct, address: 0xcd19cf65af3a3aea1f44a7cb0257fc7455f245f0, chain IDs: [1, 4]


## User Guide

All `ChainedAccount` features are available through Python or the Command Line Interface (CLI).

### Adding a new account

The following example demonstrates adding two accounts to the keystore. The first account is for use on either ethereum
mainnet or Rinkeby testnet. The second account is for use on Polygon mainnet. For a list of valid chain identifiers,
see www.chainlist.org.

```python
from chained_accounts import ChainedAccount

key = '0x57fe7105302229455bcfd58a8b531b532d7a2bb3b50e1026afa455cd332bf706'
ChainedAccount.add('my-eth-acct', chains=[1, 4], key=key, password='foo')

key = '0x7a3d4adc3b6fb4520893e9b486b67a730e0d879a421342f788dc3dc273543267'
ChainedAccount.add('my-matic-acct', chains=137, key=key, password='bar')
```

or, from the CLI:

    >> chained add my-eth-acct 0x57fe7105302229455bcfd58a8b531b532d7a2bb3b50e1026afa455cd332bf706 1 4
    Enter encryption password for my-eth-acct: 
    Confirm password:
    Added new account my-eth-acct (address= 0xcd19cf65af3a3aea1f44a7cb0257fc7455f245f0) for use on chains (1, 4)

    >> chained add my-matic-acct 0x7a3d4adc3b6fb4520893e9b486b67a730e0d879a421342f788dc3dc273543267 137
    Enter encryption password for my-matic-acct: 
    Confirm password: 
    Added new account my-matic-acct (address= 0xc1b6c5d803c45b8d1097d07df0c816157db6f00c) for use on chains (137,)

### Getting accounts from the keystore

Accounts can be accessed by `name` using `ChainedAccount.get(name)`, or can be found by searching the keystore
using `find_accounts()`. The following example demonstrates how an application can search for a user account to use on
Ethereum mainnet.

```python
acc = find_accounts(chain_id=1)[0]
print(f"Address: {acc.address}")
print(f"Chains: {acc.chains}")
```

```pycon
ChainedAccount('my-eth-acct')
Address: 0xcd19cf65af3a3aea1f44a7cb0257fc7455f245f0
Chains: [1, 4]
```

Or, from the command line (find all accounts):

    >> chained find
    Found 2 accounts.
    Account name: my-eth-acct, address: 0xcd19cf65af3a3aea1f44a7cb0257fc7455f245f0, chain IDs: [1, 4]
    Account name: my-matic-acct, address: 0xc1b6c5d803c45b8d1097d07df0c816157db6f00c, chain IDs: [137]

### Accessing private keys

Note that the `ChainedAccount` private key remains encrypted until the account is unlocked with a password.

```python
assert not ChainedAccount.get('my-eth-acct').is_unlocked
```

To unlock and access the private key:

```python
acc = ChainedAccount.get('my-eth-acct')
acc.unlock('foo')
print(f"Private key: {acc.key.hex()}")
```

```pycon
Private key: 0x57fe7105302229455bcfd58a8b531b532d7a2bb3b50e1026afa455cd332bf706
```
