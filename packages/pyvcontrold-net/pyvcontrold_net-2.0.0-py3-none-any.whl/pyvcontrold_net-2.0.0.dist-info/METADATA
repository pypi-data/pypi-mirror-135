This is a simple library to interact with vcontrold ([@openv/vcontrold](https://github.com/openv/vcontrold)), the open-source daemon to communicate with Viessmann Vitotronic via Optolink. Documentation for vcontrold itself can be found at [@openv/openv Wiki](https://github.com/openv/openv/wiki).

------
## Installation

Use pip to install the pyvcontrold-net package.

```console
(.venv) $ pip install pyvcontrold-net
```

After the installation is done, you can import the package and create an instance of vcontrold.

## Basic Usage

To use vcontrold you need to import the module vcontrold from the package vcontrold.

> :warning: You need to know your *device ID*. If you don't already know it, use :py:attr:`.device_id` to find the device ID of your heating control system. If your device ID is not listed in the ``devices`` node within ``vcontrold_config.yml``, you need to add it (or replace the existing) to each command. Otherwise no command will be processed!

```python
>>> from vcontrold import vcontrold
>>> vcd = vcontrold.vcontrold(host="127.0.0.1", port=3002, timeout=5)
>>> vcd.get_viessmann_data()
```

This will connect to you vcontold, execute all of the available commands and return the result as JSON.

For more information refer to the [Documentation](docs/index.html)

## Contribution

As I have only one heating system at home, there is no possibility to add commands to the library, which donâ€™t work on my own heating system. So if youâ€™ve identified commands, that are not initially included, open an issue and let me know to create a helpful library for all of the people out there, that donâ€™t have a fancy smart home heating control system.

## Bugs/Issues

Please report any issues you find. Iâ€™ll try to fix them asap.

## Disclaimer

Iâ€™m not responsible for the usage of this program by any other people. The software shouldnâ€™t harm the heater control in any way, but be aware, that there are official solutions from Viessmann, that can be purchased and safely used.
