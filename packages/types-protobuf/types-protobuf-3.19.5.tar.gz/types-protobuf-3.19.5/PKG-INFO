## Typing stubs for protobuf

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `protobuf` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `protobuf`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/protobuf. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

Generated with aid from mypy-protobuf v3.0.0

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `aea52b35d1f5a9306f66e1b98314f4ecbe0ffa7a`.
