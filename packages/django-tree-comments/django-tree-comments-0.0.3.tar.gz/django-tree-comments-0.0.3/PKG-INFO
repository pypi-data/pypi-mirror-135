# django-tree-comments

A django library for building comments in tree structure.

> This library is under heavy development. v0.0.0 is a placeholder version which actually contains nothing. Version numbers of the library follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/). However, to avoid version numbers grow too fast, at the experimental stage the library will be released under version number with format 0.0.x that SemVer rules do not apply.

## Features

- Query comments as a tree structure efficiently thanks to [django-tree-queries](https://github.com/matthiask/django-tree-queries).
- No generic relationships, no additional fields needed so that make comment model pure and clean.
- Provide forms, serializers, utilities and everything you need to help building a complete comment app for your django project.

## Limitations

Since the core feature for tree structure comments is based on the implementation of [django-tree-queries](https://github.com/matthiask/django-tree-queries), so this library extends the same limitations from that.
