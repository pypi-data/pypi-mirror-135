    Take a screenshot of a running Sketch.

    The returned image is a ``PIL.Image`` object. It can be assigned to a variable
    or embedded in the notebook.

    By default the Sketch will be the currently running Sketch, as returned by
    ``get_current_sketch()``. Use the ``sketch`` parameter to specify a different
    running Sketch, such as a Sketch created using Class mode.

    If your Sketch has a ``post_draw()`` method, use the ``hook_post_draw``
    parameter to make this function run after ``post_draw()`` instead of ``draw()``.
    This is important when using Processing libraries that support ``post_draw()``
    such as Camera3D or ColorBlindness."""

    Save a running Sketch's frames to a directory.

    ``get_current_sketch()``. Use the ``sketch`` parameter to specify a different
    running Sketch, such as a Sketch created using Class mode.

    If the ``limit`` parameter is used, this function will wait to return a list of
    the filenames. If not, it will return right away as the frames are saved in the
    background. It will keep doing so as long as the Sketch continues to run.

    If your Sketch has a ``post_draw()`` method, use the ``hook_post_draw``
    parameter to make this function run after ``post_draw()`` instead of ``draw()``.
