        Parameters
        ----------

        println_stream: Any
            println stream object to be used by println method

        Notes
        -----

        Customize where the output of ``println()`` goes.

        When running a Sketch asynchronously through Jupyter Notebook, any ``print``
        statements using Python's builtin function will always appear in the output of
        the currently active cell. This will rarely be desirable, as the active cell
        will keep changing as the user executes code elsewhere in the notebook. The
        ``println()`` method was created to provide users with print functionality in a
        Sketch without having to cope with output moving from one cell to the next. Use
        ``set_println_stream`` to change how the output is handled. The
        ``println_stream`` object must provide ``init()`` and ``print()`` methods, as
        shown in the example. The example demonstrates how to configure py5 to output
        text to an IPython Widget."""

            stderr: bool = False) -> None:
        """Print text or other values to the screen.

        Parameters
        ----------

        args
            values to be printed

        end: str = '\\n'
            string appended after the last value, defaults to newline character

        sep: str = ' '
            string inserted between values, defaults to a space

        stderr: bool = False
            use stderr instead of stdout

        Notes
        -----

        Print text or other values to the screen. For a Sketch running outside of a
        Jupyter Notebook, this method will behave the same as the Python's builtin
        ``print`` method. For Sketches running in a Jupyter Notebook, this will place
        text in the output of the cell that made the ``run_sketch()`` call.

        When running a Sketch asynchronously through Jupyter Notebook, any ``print``
        statements using Python's builtin function will always appear in the output of
        the currently active cell. This will rarely be desirable, as the active cell
        will keep changing as the user executes code elsewhere in the notebook. This
        method was created to provide users with print functionality in a Sketch without
        having to cope with output moving from one cell to the next.

        Use ``set_println_stream()`` to customize the behavior of ``println()``."""
        self._println_stream.print(sep.join(str(x)
                                   for x in args), end=end, stderr=stderr)
