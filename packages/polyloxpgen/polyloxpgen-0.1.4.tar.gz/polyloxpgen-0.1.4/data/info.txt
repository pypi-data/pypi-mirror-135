# NOTE: the following data files have to be present in this folder:
# - polylox_barcodelib (the complete library of all Polylox barcodes)
# - polylox_minrecs (minimal recombination number for the barcode library)
# - polylox_path_matrix_uniform (path matrix based on a uniform transition matrix;
#   used as default)
# - polylox_path_matrix_ld_2017_reorder (path matrix based on the length-dependent
#   transition matrix from Pei et al., Nature, 2017; barcode order reordered from
#   the initial version to match the current barcode library order, as stored here)
