Description: ## About The Code
        
        This is a part of the project that we are working on it for the Cyber-Physical Group (i6) at the Technical University of Munich. This package would connect to a server, find the LaTeX files, integrate the LaTeX's input and include functions, and save the file at a new directory defined by user. No matter how many files the directory in the server contains. The code will go through each folder and find the LaTeX files and write them at the new directory maintaining the directory structure in the server.
        ## How to install
        
        You can install it by running the following line in your terminal:
        ```
        pip install Connect_to_Server-CPS
        ```
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
        ```Python
        from Connect_to_Server import Connection
        
        host = "archive.cps.in.tum.de" #The host of the server
        username = "your username"
        password = "your password"
        directory = "/mnt/current/BachelorTheses/2014/" #The directory that you want to find the LaTeX files
        Save_at = "D:/CPS/HiWiProjects/Parse/data" #The new directory that you want to save the integrated LaTeX files
        
        C = Connection.Connection(host,username,password) #You are ready to connect to the server.
        
        C.Find_and_Integrate(directory,new_directory)
        
        #Note: you can also run terminal commands. For example, you can run the following code to find the folders in the directory in the server:
        
        # Connect = C.Connect()
        # ssh_stdin, ssh_stdout, ssh_stderr = Connect.exec_command("ls " + directory)
        # for line in ssh_stdout: print(line.strip())
        
        ```
