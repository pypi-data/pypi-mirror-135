## [Unreleased]
### Added

## [0.3.6] - 2021-01-23
### Added
- `signalPolarity` in the timetagging parameters (`outputPulseParameters` in configuration) now accept also `Rising` and `Falling`, which better represent it's meaning. 
- `derivativePolarity` in the timetagging parameters (`outputPulseParameters` in configuration) now accept also `Above` and `Below`, which better represent it's meaning. 
- Add unsafe switch to `generate_qua_config` function
- Add library functions and *amp() in measure statement to `generate_qua_config` function
### Changed
- Better error for library functions as save source

## [0.3.5] - 2021-12-27
### Added
- Raises an error when using Python logical operators 
- Add elif statement to `generate_qua_config` function

### Changed
- Fix indentation problem on the end of for_each block in `generate_qua_config` function
- The `generate_qua_config` now compresses lists to make the resulting file smaller and more readable

## [0.3.4] - 2021-12-05
### Added
- :guardswoman: Define multiple elements with shared oscillator.
- :guardswoman: Define an analog port with channel weights.
- Add measure and play features to `generate_qua_config` function
- format `generate_qua_config` function output
- improve `wait_for_all_values` execution time

## [0.3.3] - 2021-10-24
### Added
- :guardswoman: Define an analog port with delay.
- :guardswoman: New `set_dc_offset()` statement that can change the DC offset of element input in real time.
- :guardswoman: New input stream capabilities facilitating data transfer from job to QUA.
- :guardswoman: New flag for stream processing fft operator to control output type.
- :page_with_curl: Add information about demod on a tuple.
- :page_with_curl: Added best practice guide.
### Changed
- Validate that element has one and only one of the available input type QMQUA-26

## [0.3.2] - 2021-10-03
### Added
- :guardswoman: QuantumMachinesManager health check shows errors and warnings.
- :guardswoman: Fetching job results indicates if there were execution errors.
- :guardswoman: Define an element with multiple input ports.
- :guardswoman: Stream processing demod now supports named argument `integrate`. If `False` is provided
the demod will not sum the items, but only multiply by weights.
### Changed
- Documentation structure and content.

## [0.3.1] - 2021-09-13
### Fixed
- Fixed serialization of IO values.
- Support running `QuantumMachinesManager` inside ipython or jupyter notebook.
### Changed
- Removing deprecation notice from `with_timestamps` method on result streams.

must not appear if it does not.
