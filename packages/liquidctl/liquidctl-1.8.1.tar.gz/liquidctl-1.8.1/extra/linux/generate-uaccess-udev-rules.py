    # Rules that grant unprivileged access to devices supported by liquidctl
    #
    # Users and distros are encouraged to use these if they want liquidctl to work
    # without requiring root privileges (e.g. with the use of `sudo`).
    #
    # In the case of I²C/SMBus devices, these rules also cause the loading of the
    # `i2c-dev` kernel module.  The module is required for access to I²C/SMBus
    # devices from userspace, and loading kernel modules is in itself a privileged
    # operation.
    #
    # Distros will likely want to place this file in `/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/`,
    # while users installing this manually SHOULD use `/etc/udev/rules.d/` instead.
    #
    # The suggested name for this file is `71-liquidctl.rules`.  This was chosen
    # based on the numbering of other uaccess tagging rule files in my system (not
    # very scientific, I know, but I could not find any documented policy for
    # this), as well as the need to let users overrule these rules.
    #
    # These rules assume a system with modern versions of systemd/udev, that
    # support the `uaccess` tag; on older systems the rules can be changed to set
    # GROUP="plugdev" and MODE="0660" instead.  The currently deprecated 'plugdev'
    # group is not used by default to avoid generating warnings on systems that
    # have already removed it.
    #
    # These rules also assume that only physical sessions (or "seats") need
    # unprivileged access to the devices.  In case headless sessions are also
    # expected to interactively run liquidctl, using GROUP and MODE might be
    # preferable to TAG+="uaccess".
    #
    # Finally, this file was automatically generated.  To update it, from a Linux
    # shell and the current directory, execute:
    #
    #     $ python generate-uaccess-udev-rules.py > 71-liquidctl.rules
