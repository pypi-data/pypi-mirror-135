# Installation
<!---
## Stable release

To install scrub, run this command in your terminal:

    pip install nasa-scrub

This is the preferred method to install scrub, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) installed, this [Python installation guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/) can guide you through the process.
