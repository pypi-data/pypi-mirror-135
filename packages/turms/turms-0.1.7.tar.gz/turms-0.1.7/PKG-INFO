### DEVELOPMENT

## Inspiration

Turms is a pure python implementation of the awesome graphql-codegen library, following a simliar extensible design.
It makes heavy use of pydantic and its serialization capablities and provides fully typed querys, mutations and subscriptions

## Supports

- Documents
- Fragments
- Enums
- Query Functions

## Features

- Fully Modular (agnostic of graphql engine)
- Specify type mixins, baseclasses...
- Fully Support type hints for variables (Pylance)

## Installation

```bash
pip install turms
```

## Usage

Open your workspace (create a virtual env), in the root folder

```bash
turms init
```

This creates a configuration file in the working directory, edit this to reflect your
settings (see Configuration)

```bash
turms gen
```

Generate beautifully typed Operations, Enums,...

### Why Turms

In Etruscan religion, Turms (usually written as 𐌕𐌖𐌓𐌌𐌑 Turmś in the Etruscan alphabet) was the equivalent of Roman Mercury and Greek Hermes, both gods of trade and the **messenger** god between people and gods.
