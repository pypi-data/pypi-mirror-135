# understory

Social web framework

## A basic website



## An IndieWeb-compatible personal website

Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org).

Clone your empty website repository and descend into it. *If you
use a **private** GitHub repository your changes will be deployed through
GitHub. If you use a **public** repository your changes will be deployed
through PyPI.*

Initialize your project and add understory as a dependency.

    poetry init
    poetry add understory

Create a file `site.py`:

    from understory import indieweb
    app = indieweb.personal_site(__name__)

<!--Add your site's app as an entry point in your `pyproject.toml`:

    poetry run web install site:app AliceAnderson-->

Serve your website locally in development mode:

    poetry run web serve site:app

Open <a href=http://localhost:9000>localhost:9000</a> in your browser.

*Develop.* For example, add a custom route:

    import random
    
    @app.route(r"hello")
    class SayHello:
        return random.choice(["How you doin'?", "What's happening?", "What's up?"])

To publish:

    poetry run pkg publish patch

To deploy:

    poetry run gaea deploy site:app alice.anderson.example
