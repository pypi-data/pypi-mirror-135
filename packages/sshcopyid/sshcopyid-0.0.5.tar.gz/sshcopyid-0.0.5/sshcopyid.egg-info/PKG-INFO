Description: # ssh-copy-id
        
        Simplified replication of the linux ssh-copy-id cli for windows
        
        ## About 
        
        Since the CLI ssh-copy-id is missing when you're using a windows OS as the SSH client,
        This package is meant as a simple alternative. It's not as extensive as the original linux based shell
        command but it works as a simple alternative and uses pretty much the same syntax
        
        ## Setup
        
        On a windows OS, make sure you have python3 installed, and then install `sshcopyid` using `pip`
        
        ```
        pip install sshcopyid
        ```
        
        ## Syntax
        ```
        usage: ssh-copy-id [-h] [-p PORT] target
        
        Copy current user's ssh keys to a remote machine. 
        (This CLI is meant for use only under the windows platform)
        
        positional arguments:
          target   username@host, The username and hostname/ip of the remote host
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, -?   print this help
          -p PORT  The ssh port number of the remote machine
        ```
