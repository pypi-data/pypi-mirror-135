"""

For tomorrow:

We've already added all the new classes and functions required for dealing with the report_functions
We need to create a test that does something like
"comms.sendmsg.create_report_function()"

Then on the java side I also need a hook into the default report generator that says
 - if there's any report_functions in the inputprocessorsingleton.current_test
        - run the second report generator.

Thne you need to debug it and see what the f.. you fucked up
 --- Remember this entire functionality around being a callable python function was written this evening
    - so you probably / definitely fucked up somewhere.
