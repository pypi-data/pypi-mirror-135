Description: # python-bsc
        This is a python package containing a basic implementation of the Balanced Scorecard as designed by Kaplan and Norton. It is currently geared for agriculture but can be altered to fit any organisational need
        
        ## Implementation
        The current implementation is a mix of _sqlalchemy_ on the database side and _flask_ mixed with some bootstrap and _wtf_ _forms_. 
        The database can be spun up with a few commands as explained in more detail lower down, and the UI generated via _flask_ can be used 
        to populate the tables within the database. 
        
        Additions are relatively straight forward and so this package can be altered to suit a multitude of organisational needs
        with some adjustments, even if the stack is the only thing used. 
        
        ## Features
        * sqlalchemy back end
        * Example implementation for an agrilcultural company
        * Implements the Balanced Scorecard with objectives and measures
        * Can be run in a dockerised environment
        
        ## Requirements
        * Linux or Mac (windows not yet supported)
        * Docker
        * Postgresql client or just a psql docker container
        
        To run and use this code base you need database backend where the tables can be built. 
        I suggest running a postgresql docker container, but any standard sql contianer should work with some minor adjustments. 
        See the section on starting a docker container with postgresql.
        
        ## Getting started
        Create a virtual environment
        ```
        python3 virtualenv <name-your-env>
        source <name-your-env>/bin/activate
        ```
        
        Install the package
        ```commandline
        pip install python-bsc
        ```
        
        
        
        ## Running a postgresql docker container
        
        ```commandline
        docker run -d --name my-bsc-db -e POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust -v my_dbdata:/var/lib/postgresql/bsc-data -p 5432:5432 postgres:12
        ```
        ## Contributing
        Clone the repo
        ```commandline
        git clone 
        ```
        ## Issues
        I am super amped to improve this package and learn from the community. If you a suggestions or an improvement
        let me know or send those requests, I will do my best.
