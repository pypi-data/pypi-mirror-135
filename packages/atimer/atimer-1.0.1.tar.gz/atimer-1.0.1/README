`atimer` library implements asynchronous timer Python coroutine based on
POSIX timers. The coroutine can be used with Python `asyncio
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html>`_ module API.

The main features are

- timer expires at regular intervals
- track number of expirations if a long running task causes overrun
- start synchronized with system clock at the edge of an interval
- measure time while system is suspended
