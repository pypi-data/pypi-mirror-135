 positional arguments:
   input_A.bed           Genomic regions in BED, BED-like or bigBed format. The BED-like format
                         includes: 'bed3', 'bed4', 'bed6', 'bed12', 'bedgraph', 'narrowpeak',
                         'broadpeak', 'gappedpeak'. BED and BED-like format can be plain text,
                         compressed (.gz, .z, .bz, .bz2, .bzip2) or remote (http://, https://, ftp://)
                         files. Do not compress BigBed foramt. BigBed file can also be a remote file.
   input_B.bed           Genomic regions in BED, BED-like or bigBed format. The BED-like format
                         includes: 'bed3', 'bed4', 'bed6', 'bed12', 'bedgraph', 'narrowpeak',
                         'broadpeak', 'gappedpeak'. BED and BED-like format can be plain text,
                         compressed (.gz, .z, .bz, .bz2, .bzip2) or remote (http://, https://, ftp://)
                         files. Do not compress BigBed foramt. BigBed file can also be a remote file.

   -h, --help            show this help message and exit
   -n ITER, --ndraws ITER
                         Times of resampling to estimate confidence intervals. Set to '0' to turn off
                         resampling.(default: 20)
   -f SUBSAMPLE, --fraction SUBSAMPLE
                         Resampling fraction. (default: 0.75)
   -b BGSIZE, --background BGSIZE
                         The size of the cis-regulatory genomic regions. This is about 1.4Gb For the
                         human genome. (default: 1400000000)
   -o, --save            If set, will save peak-wise coefficients to files
                         ("input_A_peakwise_scores.tsv" and "input_B_peakwise_scores.tsv").
   -d, --debug           Print detailed information for debugging


Example
-------

Calculate the **overall** overlap coefficient and **peak-wise** overlap coefficients between CTCF binding sites and RAD21 binding sites.

:code:`python3 ../bin/cobind.py overlap CTCF_ENCFF660GHM.bed RAD21_ENCFF057JFH.bed --save`

The overall overlapping coefficient between *CTCF_ENCFF660GHM.bed* and *RAD21_ENCFF057JFH.bed* was printed to screen
