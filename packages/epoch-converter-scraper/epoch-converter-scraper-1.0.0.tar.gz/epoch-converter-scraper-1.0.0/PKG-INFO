Epoch converter Scraper is a python library to scrape epoch converter, using browser automation. 
It currently runs only on windows.

## Scrape Epoch Converter Data
* In this, we first import library, then we fetched data using simple function. 
* Replace **"3"** with **"your data"**.

```json
from epoch_converter_scraper import *
response=epoch.timestamp_converter(time_stamp="3")
```
### Response Data
```json
 "Column A@txt": "Assuming that this timestamp is in seconds:GMT: Thursday, January 13, 2022 4:49:47 AMYour time zone: Thursday, January 13, 2022 4:49:47 AM GMT+00:00Relative: 2 minutes ago"
```

#### Bot Studio
