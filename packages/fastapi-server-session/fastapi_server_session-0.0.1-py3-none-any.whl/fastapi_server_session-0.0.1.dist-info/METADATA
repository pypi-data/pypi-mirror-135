FastAPI Server Session is a dependency-based extension for FastAPI that adds support for server-sided session management.

At the moment, it supports using Redis as the session datastore. But in the future, it will support even more datastores including but not limited to SQL, MongoDB, etc.

## Quickstart

```py
from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI
from fastapi_server_session import SessionManager, RedisSessionInterface, Session

import redis

api = FastAPI()

session_manager = SessionManager(
    interface=RedisSessionInterface(redis.from_url("redis://localhost"))
)

@api.get("/set")
async def set_session(session: Session = Depends(session_manager.use_session)):
    session["key"] = "value"
    return {"status": "ok"}

@api.get("/get")
async def get_session(session: Session = Depends(session_manager.use_session)):
    return {"value": session["key"]} # or session.get("key")
```
