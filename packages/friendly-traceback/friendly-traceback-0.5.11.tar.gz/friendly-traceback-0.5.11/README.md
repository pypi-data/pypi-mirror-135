# friendly/friendly-traceback

- **friendly_traceback**: Helps understand Python traceback
- **friendly**: Prettier version of the above with some additional enhancements.

This code repository is for **friendly_traceback**.

Unless specified otherwise, from here on, **Friendly** will refer to both
**friendly** and **friendly_traceback**

## Description

Created with Python beginners in mind, but also useful for experienced users,
**Friendly** replaces standard tracebacks
by something easier to understand, translatable into various languages. 
Currently, the information provided by **Friendly** is only available
in two languages: English and French.

The additional information provided by **Friendly** includes
`why()` a certain exception occurred,
`what()` it means, exactly `where()` it occurred including
the value of relevant variables, and
[more](https://aroberge.github.io/friendly-traceback-docs/docs/html/).


![Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aroberge/friendly/master/why_1.png)
The screenshot above was taken on Windows. In some other operating systems
you might need to type `python3` instead of `python`: **Friendly**
requires Python version 3.6 or newer.

## Installation

```
python -m pip install friendly_traceback
```

Note that most users should install **friendly** instead of **friendly_traceback**,

```
python -m pip install friendly
```

This needs to be done from a terminal.
In the command shown above,
`python` refers to whatever you need to type to invoke your
favourite Python interpreter.
It could be `python`, `python3`, `py -3.8`, etc.


For some special cases, including
using a specialized editor like [Mu](https://codewith.mu) that has its own way
of installing Python packages, please consult the documentation.

## Documentation

[The documentation is available by clicking here.](https://friendly-traceback.github.io/docs/index.html)

## Example

The following example illustrates the information that can
be provided by **Friendly**.

```
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<friendly-console:5>", line 1, in <module>
        test()
      File "<friendly-console:4>", line 2, in test
        a = cost(pi)
    NameError: name 'cost' is not defined

        Did you mean `cos`?

    A `NameError` exception indicates that a variable or
    function name is not known to Python.
    Most often, this is because there is a spelling mistake.
    However, sometimes it is because the name is used
    before being defined or given a value.

    In your program, `cost` is an unknown name.
    Instead of writing `cost`, perhaps you meant one of the following:
    *   Global scope: `cos`, `cosh`, `acos`

    Execution stopped on line 1 of file `'<friendly-console:5>'`.

    -->1: test()

            test: <function test>

    Exception raised on line 2 of file `'<friendly-console:4>'`.

       1: def test():
    -->2:    a = cost(pi)
                 ^^^^

            global pi: 3.141592653589793
```
