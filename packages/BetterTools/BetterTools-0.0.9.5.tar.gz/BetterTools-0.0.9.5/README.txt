This is a lib to improove input() fonction.

DOCS:
    cls() fonction :
        -> clear console

    Binput() fonction:
        take multiple arguments :
            Input_message : By default it's "". This is the message which is going to be with the input()
            ex : Binput(Input_message = "Hey :") 
            >>> Hey : (<- input) 
        
            Input_type : By default it's "str". Ths is the type of answer you're waiting in your input() 
            This is the same things as doing this : 
            Binput(Input_message = "Hey :", Input_type = "int") 
            <=> int(input("Hey :")) 

            error_message : By default it's "". This is the message which is going to be print in case of an error 
            with the input, like if you write a string but you're waiting for an int. By default the message is : 
            "You didn't write an {Input_type.__name__} !" 
            ex: Binput(Input_message = "Hey :", Input_type = "int", error_message = "You had to write a integer !") 
            >>> Hey : hello 
            >>> You had to write a integer ! 

            clear : By default it's False. This is if you want to clear the console after an error in an input() 

            delay : By default it's 0. This the time between the error message and the callback fonction 

            func :  By default it's False. This is the function you want to callback after an error on the Binput. 

            kwargs : Are all the arguments you want to use for the callback function 
            You have to write the var name before the argument ! 
            ex: Binput(Input_message="test :", ... ,clear=True, delay=1, 
            func=function, First_Arg="yes", Second_Arg="an other one" ...)
