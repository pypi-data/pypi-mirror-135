Description: This is a lib to improove input() fonction.
        
        DOCS:
            cls() fonction :
                -> clear console
        
            Binput() fonction:
                take multiple arguments :
                    Input_message : By default it's "". This is the message which is going to be with the input()
                    ex : Binput(Input_message = "Hey :") 
                    >>> Hey : (<- input) 
                
                    Input_type : By default it's "str". Ths is the type of answer you're waiting in your input() 
                    This is the same things as doing this : 
                    Binput(Input_message = "Hey :", Input_type = "int") 
                    <=> int(input("Hey :")) 
        
                    error_message : By default it's "". This is the message which is going to be print in case of an error 
                    with the input, like if you write a string but you're waiting for an int. By default the message is : 
                    "You didn't write an {Input_type.__name__} !" 
                    ex: Binput(Input_message = "Hey :", Input_type = "int", error_message = "You had to write a integer !") 
                    >>> Hey : hello 
                    >>> You had to write a integer ! 
        
                    clear : By default it's False. This is if you want to clear the console after an error in an input() 
        
                    delay : By default it's 0. This the time between the error message and the callback fonction 
        
                    func :  By default it's False. This is the function you want to callback after an error on the Binput. 
        
                    kwargs : Are all the arguments you want to use for the callback function 
                    You have to write the var name before the argument ! 
                    ex: Binput(Input_message="test :", ... ,clear=True, delay=1, 
                    func=function, First_Arg="yes", Second_Arg="an other one" ...)

                and Binput(Input_message, Input_type, error_message, clear, delay , func, kwargs)             with all these args
        
            -> 13/01/2022

                Add p(text) and i(text) like print() and input() but faster to write
        
            -> 15/01/2022
        
                0.0.5

                0.0.6
        
                Fix p() probleme, and add all normal print() function arguments into p(), like end="", sep="" etc
        
                Add loading() function, which create a loading print. Usefull for for loops.
