Description: # Vitis Quantizer
        
        **THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL XILINX PACKAGE**
        
        A pip installable package to do the vitis model quantization for tensorflow 2.
        
        This is a migration of the code [here](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-AI/tree/master/tools/Vitis-AI-Quantizer/vai_q_tensorflow2.x/tensorflow_model_optimization/python/core/quantization/keras/vitis)
        to a standalone pip package that won't conflict with the `tensorflow-model-optimization` package.
        
        Working in the docker image is annoying and this code should be standalone.
        
        ## Install
        
        ```bash
        pip install vitis-quantizer
        ```
        
        Build from source:
        
        ```bash
        python3 setup.py bdist_wheel
        pip install dist/vitis_quantizer-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Usage is the same as Vitis AI models.
        
        ```python
        import tensorflow as tf
        import vitis_quantizer
        
        # Train/Get/Make a keras model somehow
        model = tf.keras.models.load_model("/path/to/keras/model")
        quantizer = vitis_quantizer.VitisQuantizer(model)
        with vitis_quantizer.quantize_scope():
            quantized_model = quantizer.quantize_model(calib_dataset=dataset)
            quantized_model.save("/path/to/save/quantized/model")
        ```
        
        After you have the quantized model saved, use vitis compile.sh script.
