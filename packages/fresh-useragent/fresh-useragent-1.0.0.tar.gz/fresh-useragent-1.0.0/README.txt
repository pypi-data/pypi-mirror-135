Hey! This is a simple to use Python package to randomly get an useragent.

This is great for scraping and has up to date User Agents.

Note: Always update this package, it will include more user agents and more up to date ones...




To use this just use the following:

  from fresh_useragent import UserAgent
  ua = UserAgent()
  print(ua)
