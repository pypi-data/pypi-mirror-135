# DarkLim
-------

DarkLim provides statistical tools for calculating dark matter exclusion limits and sensitivity estimates.

To install the most recent development version of DarkLim, clone this repo, then from the top-level directory of the repo, type the following line into your command line

`pip install .`

If using a shared Python installation, you may want to add the `--user` flag to the above line.

**NOTE:** This package also requires a Fortran compiler for installation. We recommend installing `gfortran`, which can be done via `sudo apt-get install gfortran` on Linux.
