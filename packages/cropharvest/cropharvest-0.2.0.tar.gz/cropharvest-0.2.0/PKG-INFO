# CropHarvest

CropHarvest is an open source remote sensing dataset for agriculture with benchmarks. It collects data from a variety of agricultural land use datasets and remote sensing products.


### Installation

`cropharvest` can be pip installed by running `pip install cropharvest`

### Getting started
See the [`demo.ipynb`](demo.ipynb) notebook for an example on how to download the data from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/5533193) and train a random forest against this data.

For more examples of models trained against this dataset, see the [benchmarks](benchmarks).

More details about CropHarvest and the benchmarks are available in [this paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=JtjzUXPEaCu).

### Contributing
If you would like to contribute a dataset, please see the [contributing readme](contributing.md).
