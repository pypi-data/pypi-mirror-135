Coin Desk Scraper is a python library to scrape bitcoin details, using browser automation. 
It currently runs only on windows.

##  Scrape bitcoin details

 * Replace below currency link with **"link"**

```sh

      "market_capital": "$373.90B",

#### Bot Studio
For this project, we implemented an automated browser that scrapes bitcoin details. [Bot Studio](https://pypi.org/project/botstudio/) is needed for browser automation.
