# simple_tools

Simplifield tools to ease the use of the more advanced tools of Python.

The point of the library is to ease the use of tools that aren't in most of the
beginner proyects, that are making their way into entry level jobs.

At the moment, the things that I have my eye on are logging and threads. Yeah I
know, you should never use threads, just use async, but sometimes changing sync
code to async is a pain, so my goal is to help with that.
