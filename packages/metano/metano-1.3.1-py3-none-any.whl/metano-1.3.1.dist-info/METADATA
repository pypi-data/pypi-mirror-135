# Metano

For installation instructions and further information about Metano,
please visit [the project homepage](http://mmtb.brenda-enzymes.org/metano), where we also provide a detailed [documentation](https://mmtb.brenda-enzymes.org/metano/manual).

# MMTB
The [Metano Modeling Toolbox (MMTB)](https://mmtb.brenda-enzymes.org) is a web-based toolbox that assists during model creation and analysis.
Many Metano tools (FBA, FVA, split-ratio, ...) can be used via MMTB without installation. Furthermore, MMTB offers different visualizations for your metabolic models, and a platform for the distribution of models.
