Ignition is a set of packages and modules that allows developers to get code completion for Ignition Scripting API scripting functions in their IDE of choice.

## Releases

Check the [releases page](https://github.com/thecesrom/Ignition/releases) and download the one for your current version.

If you can't find it, feel free to submit your request on our [Discussions](https://github.com/thecesrom/Ignition/discussions).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* You have installed Python 2.7.18 ([download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2718/))
* You are familiar with [Ignition 8.0 Scripting Functions](https://docs.inductiveautomation.com/display/DOC80/Scripting+Functions)

## Packages

Ignition consists of the following packages:

* com
* java/javax
* system

### com

These are libraries for some of Inductive Automation's Java packages and functions that are imported in `system` packages.

### java/javax

These are libraries for some Java packages and functions that are imported in `system` packages meant to be used on development environments where no JDK can be installed, and the project interpreter is Python 2.7.

### system

Is a package that includes all Ignition Scripting Functions.

## Installation and usage

### Installing with `pip`

The preferred method is to install it by running `pip`. It requires Python 2.7.18, or higher.

```bash
python2 -m pip install ignition-api==8.0.17.post5
```

This will install it as package to your Python installation, which will allow you to call Ignition Scripting functions from Python's REPL, and get code completion using an IDE (we recommend PyCharm).

```bash
Python 2.7.18 (default, Nov  9 2020, 16:23:15) 
[GCC Apple LLVM 12.0.0 (clang-1200.0.32.21)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from __future__ import print_function
>>> import system.util
>>> print(system.util.__doc__)
Utility Functions.

The following functions give you access to view various Gateway and
Client data, as well as interact with other various systems.

>>> system.util.beep()
>>> quit()
```

And to uninstall:

```bash
python2 -m pip uninstall ignition-api
```

### Downloading from releases

You may also download the code targeted to your desired version from the [releases page](https://github.com/thecesrom/Ignition/releases) and add it as a dependency to your scripting project.
