While this library as been inspired by the autowiring mechanism of Spring, it is still immature,\nwith a reduced scope and present some limitation (due to :code:`metaclass`). While some limitation are expected to change in future version, it's future is still\nuncertain, so use with caution.\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nJust follow this link: https://deaf-adder.github.io/deafadder-container/#/\n\nFancy a more example base approach ? The documentation is full of examples and the tests files should be enough to have a better understanding of\nwhat can be achieved.\n\nExpected future developments\n----------------------------\n\n- getting rid of the :code:`metaclass` to achieve the same, or similar, result *(why ? Because I'd like to include dependency injection based on ABC class\n  which are :code:`metaclass` and one object could not extends an ABC class and be have a :code:`Component` metaclass as well)*\n- add a section to present projects build around this library\n\n",
