# EASCherSim

This is the release of *EASCherSim*!

This tool simulates the cherenkov light emission for extensive airshowers with trajectories below and above the limb as a full Monte Carlo simulation.
As a result it provides the photon spatial, time and angular distribution at the detection plane. The tool has the option to take the effect of a magnetic field into account.
Various plots can be automatically produced and the results can be saved into root format.

# Installation

`EASCherSim` is available through [pip]() or [conda]().

`python3 -m pip install EASCherSim`  
`conda install EASCherSim` (not done yet)

*Note:* We recommand the conda install as this option will also install the root which is as of now the only implemeted output format.


# Usage


### Create a configuration file

The command line simulator uses store simulation settings in an ini file (read by configparser). To
generate a configuration file run the following, with your choice of file name.
All option can be specified via argument as well (see help menu for details).

`easchersim make-config my_config_file.ini`

### Run cherenkov simulation

Simulate cherenkov photons at detection plane

`easchersim run my_config_file.ini`

# Documentation

The sphinx documentation is available at [GitLab](https://c4341.gitlab.io/easchersim/)


### Help Documentation

Use the `-h` flag for documentation.

```
$ easchersim --help
usage: easchersim [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]

OPTIONS:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit

COMMANDS:
  {run,make-config}
