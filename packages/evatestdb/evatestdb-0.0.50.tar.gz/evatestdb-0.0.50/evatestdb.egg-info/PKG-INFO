## What is EVA?

EVA is a visual data management system (think MySQL for videos). It supports a declarative language similar to SQL and a wide range of commonly used  computer vision models.

## What does EVA do?

* EVA **enables querying of visual data** in user facing applications by providing a simple SQL-like interface for a wide range of commonly used computer vision models.

* EVA **improves throughput** by introducing sampling, filtering, and caching techniques.

* EVA **improves accuracy** by introducing state-of-the-art model specialization and selection algorithms.

## Installation

EVA requires Python 3.7 or later. To install EVA, we recommend using pip:
```shell
