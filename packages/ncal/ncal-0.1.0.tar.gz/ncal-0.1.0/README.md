# 2-Way Sync for Notion and Google Calendar

Currently reworking this fork. It will eventually be a simple command that can be set to run, either continuously or just once.

Configuration is via toml, command line flags, or environment variables (including via a .env file).

See [old README.md](./oldREADME.md) for more info.


Reading through `config.py` will give a lot of useful information on config options. Run `ncal --help` to get more info on the cli command.
