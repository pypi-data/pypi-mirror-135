# django-dkron

Manage and run jobs in Dkron from your django project

## ToDo

* Make README useful!
* Make notifications dependency optional?
* Replace templates with core theme compatible ones (move these to surface).
* Document reverse proxy usage (for authentication) or create the JWT/oauth app (and recommend it from here).
* document WEBHOOK configuration (add to `urls.py`) as done in testapp.
* how to set DKRON_TOKEN.
* find any `FIXME`/`TODO` in code
* move all admin.py HTML to templates that can be overriden
