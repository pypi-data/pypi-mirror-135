## Install ffe

```
python -m pip install ffe
```

## Install recipes

Ffe by itself can do nothing, you can write recipes yourself or download recipes written by others.

Please always inspect the recipe before installing it. For example,

Use `ffe install --peek https://github.com/ahui2016/ffe/raw/main/recipes/swap.py` to read a short description of the recipe.

Use `ffe install -d https://github.com/ahui2016/ffe/raw/main/recipes/swap.py` to download it, the content will be print to the screen, you can also use `ffe install -d http://example.com/recipe.py > recipe.py` to create a file.

After inspection, use `ffe install -i https://github.com/ahui2016/ffe/raw/main/recipes/swap.py` to install it.

Now, you can use `ffe info -a` to list out all installed recipes, and use `ffe info -r swap` to read more about the recipe (change swap to another recipe's name as you want).


## Use a recipe

Use `ffe info -r <recipe>` to read more about a recipe, or use `ffe dump -r <recipe> <files...>` to generate a plan of tasks, for example

```
ffe dump -r swap file1.txt file2.txt > swap.toml
```

will generate a TOML file as below:
```
[[tasks]]
recipe = "swap"
names = [ "file1.txt", "file2.txt",]

[tasks.options]
verbose = true
```

And then, use `ffe run -f swap.toml` to do the job. You can also run `ffe run -r swap file1.txt file2.txt`, but without a TOML file you cannot set options.

It is recommended to use a **--dry-run** flag when you are not familiar with the recipe yet. for example `ffe run -dry -f swap.toml`.
