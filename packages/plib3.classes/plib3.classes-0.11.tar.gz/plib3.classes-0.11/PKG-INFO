plib3.classes
=============

The PLIB3.CLASSES package contains a number of useful
Python 3 classes. The latest official release is
available on PyPI at
https://pypi.org/project/plib3.classes/
and the latest source code is available on Gitlab at
https://gitlab.com/pdonis/plib3-classes.

PLIB3.CLASSES is built using the ``build`` PEP 517 build tool
with the ``setuputils_build`` backend, which uses the
``setuputils`` helper module to build the setup.cfg file that
is included with the distribution. This module and build backend
are available at https://gitlab.com/pdonis/setuputils3.

The PLIB3.CLASSES Package
-------------------------

The following classes are available in the ``plib.classes`` namespace:

- The ``StateMachine`` class implements a basic finite state machine
  with customizable code to be run at each state transition.

Installation
------------

The simplest way to install PLIB3.CLASSES is by using ``pip``:

    $ python3 -m pip install plib3.classes

This will download the latest release from PyPI and install it
on your system. If you already have a downloaded source tarball or
wheel, you can have ``pip`` install it directly by giving its
filename in place of "plib3.classes" in the above command line.

The Zen of PLIB3
----------------

There is no single unifying purpose or theme to PLIB3, but
like Python itself, it does have a 'Zen' of sorts:

- Express everything possible in terms of built-in Python
  data structures.

- Once you've expressed it that way, what the code is
  going to do with it should be obvious.

- Avoid boilerplate code, *and* boilerplate data. Every
  piece of data your program needs should have one and
  only one source.
