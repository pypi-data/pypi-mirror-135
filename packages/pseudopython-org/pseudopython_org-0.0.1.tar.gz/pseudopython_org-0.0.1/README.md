## About

Pseudopython.org converts code snippets written in Python into Pseudocode, and seeks to help teachers and students to effectively learn its concept and applicability.

We use the approved notation for developing pseudocode suggested by the [International Baccalaureate](https://ib.compscihub.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IB-Pseudocode-rules-more.pdf).
