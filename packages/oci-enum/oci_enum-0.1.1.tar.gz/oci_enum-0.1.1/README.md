## Intro ##
OCI Enum is designed to help enumerate various services in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
It can use two modes of authentication - with user credentials, similarly to [OCI's official tool](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/cliconcepts.htm) and using a compute instance's identity.
To obtain an instance's identity file, log on to the instance, and use `wget` (or another method of your choice) to download the json file from `http://169.254.169.254/opc/v1/identity`.
