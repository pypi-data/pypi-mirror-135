2,"""Tysabri has changed my life. I have had 20 infusions now. At first I could feel a major ""up"" and then could slowly feel the medicine wearing off towards the end of the 28-day cycle. Now I don't feel much of an up or a down, but I feel consistent and ""normal"" again. I feel more level-headed, have consistent energy levels, and am able to work out at the gym two hours a day! The only side effect I've ever had was a bad headache on the evening of my infusion for the first 2 or 3 months. At my 6-month MRI/follow-up we found out that the Tysabri was actually causing a significant reduction in my lesions. I haven't had a relapse and only a handful of flare-ups (that last maybe an hour tops).""","[{""start"": 421, ""end"": 428, ""text"": ""headache""}]"
5,"""Been on this for 3 weeka and sugars great now. Has side effects of tiredness, increased pulse and severe heartburn but all gone now. Lost 5kg first week but nothing since then.

6,"""I appeared to have a kidney infection because of the pain. Dr gave me metronidazole but the side effects were horrible - I thought I was having a heart attack from the pain/pressure.  Amoxicillin was tried but 3 weeks later little better.  When I ran out of Amoxicillin within 24 hours I was in horrible pain again and went to the ER.  Like others the Dr said everything is GREAT, you can go home.  No way I feel like crap so he did a CT.  The CT showed diverticulitis.  Vindicated!  But then he prescribed Cipro and metronidazole.  I'd taken Cipro last year and it destroyed my knees...I was on crutches for months.  Trying just the metronidazole, still feel crappy, but pain is going away.  Why not Augmentin?""","[{""start"": 169, ""end"": 172, ""text"": ""pain""}, {""start"": 174, ""end"": 181, ""text"": ""pressure""}]"
14,"""I have always used Natural Family Planning until my husband and I started working at the same hospital and our hours made it impossible to keep track of everything like we had previously. I decided I'd try the lowest dose of Birth Control which is the Nuva ring. I had it in for less than one week because I became extremely depressed, crying spells, constipated, and nauseated. All of this mattered but I felt like my body needed to adjust to this... until, after sex I was bleeding and the left side of my vagina was very painful.

20,"""Not too bad, this is my second time taking the medication. The first time I was given lansoprazole, amoxicillin and METRONIDAZOLE which I had major side effects and after reading horror story reviews I stopped at day 5 of 7. Later found out it was the metronidazole that caused my horrible side effects.

Now I'm on the course again, but instead of metronidazole I was prescribed CLARITHROMYCIN which IS SO MUCH BETTER!!! Apart from the occasional nausea and metallic/bitter taste, I've had no other side effect and it's helped increase my appetite. I'm on day 4 of 7 now, and have high hopes for this drug. Will update after I finish the treatment.""","[{""start"": 434, ""end"": 454, ""text"": ""the occasional nausea""}, {""start"": 460, ""end"": 480, ""text"": ""metallic/bitter taste""}]"
