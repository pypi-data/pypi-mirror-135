LabExT, short for Laboratory Experiment Tool, is a software environment for performing laboratory
experiments on silicon-photonic devices and chips. The tool is free, written in Python 3.8 and uses the I/O API VISA
through [pyvisa](https://github.com/pyvisa/pyvisa).

More general: if you need to run measurement algorithms with SCPI-talking instruments in a laboratory, it is highly
likely that you will find LabExT useful.

## Highlights
* Execute pre-defined measurement routines using laboratory instruments at any VISA address.
  * Measurement code and instrument driver code easily extensible via their API. 
* Immediately investigate and plot the resulting data.
  * Commenting on resulting data is immediately possible after measurement.
  * A large set of meta-data is also recorded.
* Chip-scale automation with motorized stages.
  * Supports coordinate files of on-chip devices and moves stages to correct locations (e.g. for coupling fibers to on-chip grating couplers).
  * Local optical coupling optimization including Gaussian mode profile fitting.
* High Usability
  * No Python coding knowledge necessary to execute lab experiments!
  * Keyboard shortcuts!

## Video
Before losing too many words, check out the following video which demonstrates how we use LabExT in our daily work:

[![LabExT Demo Video](docs/img/youtube_demo_vid.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qIm3p-ml3Y "Click to watch the LabExT demo video on youtube.")

It shows the basics of single measurements and chip-level automation for optical testing.

## Links
Here are the three most important pieces of documentation you will need:

* Full documentation incl. detailed installation instructions and getting started guide: [labext.readthedocs.io](https://labext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
* Press F1 in the main window to open the addon documentation.
* For guidelines on how to contribute to the LabExT codebase, see [the contribution guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Installation
Assuming you use conda as environment manager, installation is straight forward:
```
conda create -n LabExT_env python=3.8
conda activate LabExT_env
pip install LabExT-pkg
```

For a detailed installation and configuration guide, please consult the [online installation guide](https://labext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/).
If you plan on developing for LabExT, see the [development setup guide](https://labext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup_dev_env/).

## Acknowledgements & Reference
LabExT is written in part by tireless folks at the
[Institute of Electromagnetic Fields, ETH Zurich, Switzerland](https://ief.ee.ethz.ch) as part of their daily grind in
an RF and optics laboratory.

Another big part is written by [Polariton Technologies](https://www.polariton.ch/) whose support and experience in
integrated optics design and the testing thereof we gratefully acknowledge.
