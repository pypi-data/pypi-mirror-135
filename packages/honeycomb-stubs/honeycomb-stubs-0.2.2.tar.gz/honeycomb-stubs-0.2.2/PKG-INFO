# honeycomb-stubs

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/honeycomb-stubs)](https://pypi.org/project/honeycomb-stubs/)

Python type stubs for:

  * [libhoney](https://github.com/honeycombio/libhoney-py)
  * [beeline](https://github.com/honeycombio/beeline-python)

The stubs for `beeline` are relatively complete, but the stubs for `libhoney`
are woefully incomplete. PRs welcome!

## Usage

```
pip install honeycomb-stubs
```
