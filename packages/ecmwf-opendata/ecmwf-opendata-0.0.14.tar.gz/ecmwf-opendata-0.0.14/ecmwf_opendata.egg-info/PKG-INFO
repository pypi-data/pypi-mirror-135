# ecmwf-opendata

A package to download ECMWF open data

```python
from ecmwf.opendata import Client

client = Client()

client.retrieve(
    date=-1,
    time=6,
    step=144,
    stream="waef",
    type="cf",
    target="data.grib",
    param="mwd",
)
```


## Download examples

### Download a single surface parameter at a single forecast step from ECMWF's 00UTC HRES forecast

```python
from ecmwf.opendata import Client

client = Client(source="ecmwf")

client.retrieve(
    time=0,
    stream="oper",
    type="fc",
    step=24,
    param="2t",
    target="data.grib2",
)


```

- For HRES Atmospheric model products at time=06 or time=12, use `stream = "scda",`

### Download the Tropical Cyclone tracks from ECMWF's 00UTC HRES forecast (Set I-iii)

```python
from ecmwf.opendata import Client

client = Client(source="ecmwf")

client.retrieve(
    time=0,
    stream="oper",
    type="tf",
    step=240,
    target="data.bufr",
)
```
- The downloaded data are encoded in BUFR edition 4
- For the HRES Tropical Cyclone tracks at time=06 and time=18 use:
```python
...
   stream = "scda",
   step = 90,
...
```

### Download a single surface parameter at a single forecast step for all ensemble members from ECMWF's 12UTC 00UTC ENS forecast

```python
from ecmwf.opendata import Client

client = Client(source = "ecmwf")

client.retrieve(
   time = 0,
   stream = "enfo",
   type = "pf",
   param = "msl",
   target = "data.grib2"
)
```
- To download a single ensemble member, use the **number** keyword:  `number = [1,]`.
- All of the odd numbered ensemble members use `number = [num for num in range(1,51,2)]`.
- To download the control member, use `type = "cf"`.

### Download the Tropical Cyclone tracks from ECMWF's 00UTC ENS forecast

The Tropical Cyclone tracks are identified by the keyword `type = "tf"`.

```python
from ecmwf.opendata import Client

client = Client(source="ecmwf")

client.retrieve(
    time=0,
    stream="enfo",
    type="tf",
    step=240,
    target="data.bufr",
)

```
- The downloaded data are encoded in BUFR edition 4
- For the ENS Tropical Cyclone tracks at time=06 and time=18 replace `step = [240,]` with `step = [144,]`.

### Download the ensemble mean and standard deviation for all parameters at a single forecast step from ECMWF's 00UTC ENS forecast

The ensemble mean and standard deviation are identified by the keywords `type = "em"`:

```python
from ecmwf.opendata import Client

client = Client(source="ecmwf")

client.retrieve(
    time=0,
    stream="enfo",
    type="em",
    step=24,
    target="data.grib2",
)

```
and `type = "es"`, respectively:
```python
from ecmwf.opendata import Client

client = Client(source="ecmwf")

client.retrieve(
    time=0,
    stream="enfo",
    type="es",
    step=24,
    target="data.grib2",
)

```

### Download the ensemble probability products

The ensemble probability products are identified by the keyword`type = "ep"`.  The probability products are available only for time=00 and time=12.

Two different productsa are available.

#### Probabilities - Instantaneous weather events - Pressure levels

The probability of temperature standardized anomalies at a constant pressure level of 850hPa are available at 12 hourly forecast steps.

```python
from ecmwf.opendata import Client

client = Client(source="ecmwf")

client.retrieve(
    time=0,
    stream="enfo",
    type="ep",
    step=[i for i in range(12, 361, 12)],
    levtype="pl",
    levelist=850,
    param=[
        "ptsa_gt_1stdev",
        "ptsa_gt_1p5stdev",
        "ptsa_gt_2stdev",
        "ptsa_lt_1stdev",
        "ptsa_lt_1p5stdev",
        "ptsa_lt_2stdev",
    ],
    target="data.grib2",
)

```
#### Probabilities - Daily weather events - Single level

The probabilities of total precipitation and wind gusts exceeding specified thresholds in a 24 hour period are available for step ranges 0-24 to 336-360 by 12​​.  These are specified in the retrieval request using, e.g.: `step = ["0-24", "12-36", "24-48"]`.

```python
from ecmwf.opendata import Client

client = Client(source="ecmwf")

steps = [f"{12 * i}-{ 12 * i + 24}" for i in range(29)]

client.retrieve(
    time=0,
    stream="enfo",
    type="ep",
    step=steps,
    levtype="sfc",
    param=["tpg1", "tpg5", "10fgg10"],
    target="data.grib2",
)
