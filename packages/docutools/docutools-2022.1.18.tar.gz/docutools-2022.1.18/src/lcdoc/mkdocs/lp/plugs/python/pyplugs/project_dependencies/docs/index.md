# Project :srcref:fn=src/lcdoc/mkdocs/lp/plugs/python/pyplugs/project_dependencies/__init__.py,t=Dependencies

Scans a poetry lock file and extracts all project dependencies.

- Creates CREDITS.md based on a poetry lock file, i.e. currently requires poetry as a build system
- Heavily based on the work of ["pawamoy"](https://github.com/pawamoy).
- Example: This repo's [Credits Page](../../../../about/credits.md).

## Usage

```
`lp:python show=project_dependencies`
```
