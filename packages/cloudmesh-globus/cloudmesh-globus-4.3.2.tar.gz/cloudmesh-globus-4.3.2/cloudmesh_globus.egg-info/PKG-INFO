        =============
        
        ```
        Usage:
        globus login FROM_EP TO_EP
        globus transfer FROM_EP TO_EP DIR FROM TO [--mkdir=no] [--tar] [--force] [--dryrun]
        globus transfer FROM_EP TO_EP DIR --file=FILE TO [--mkdir=no] [--run=1:100] [--tar] [--force] [--dryrun]
        
        Arguments:
        FROM_EP   the globus endpoint to transfer the file from
        TO_EP     the globus endpoint to transfer the file to
        DIR       the base directory from which to transfer. All transfers
        are done relative to this DIR and the new remote directory
        will not have the prefix DIR.
        FROM      a relative directory to transfer files from
        TO        the directory to transfer the relative directory FROM
        FILE      a file that contains files or directories to transfer
        
        Options:
        --file=FILE  specify the file that contains the transfers
        --tar        transfer the data in a tar file
        --mkdir=no   assume the remote directory to place the file in is
                     already created This can speed up the transfer in
                     case you have many transfers to execute.  So create
                     the file tree first. It also helps in case a transfer
                     failed and you need to redo it, but the directories
                     are already created.
        --force      in case force is not specified and the tar file already 
            exists on the remote, the transfer will be not conducted.
            With force the transfer will be done.
        --run=1:10   Only execute the transfers in the lines 1 to 10 
                    
        
        Description:
        
        globus transfer FROM_EP TO_EP DIR FROM TO [--mkdir=no] [--tar]
        
        This command is a convenience wrapper for the globus command
        allowing the transfer of relative directories towards a source
        directory. The program creates on the destination the same
        directory tree as on the source starting from the base directory
        specified with DIR. The FROM directory locates at DIR/FROM is
        then copied to TO without the prefix DIR.
        
        If you specify the --mkdir=no the destination directory is assumed to
        exist and is not explicitly created. If it does not exist the program
        will be terminated.
        
        bookmarks
        bookmarks can be stored in a file called
        ~/.cloudmesh/globus.yaml
        
        let us assume the file contains
        
        bookmark:
        uva: c4d80096-7612-11e7-8b5e-22000b9923ef
        laptoa: 1a1a1a1--7612-11e7-8b5e-22000b9923ef
        
        then you can use the keyword uva for an endpoint in the command
        
        Examples:
        
        Transfer via multiple globus tasks
        
        cd mydir
        ls -1 > file.txt
        cat -n file.txt
        
        cms globus transfer mars uva `pwd` --file=files.txt /remotedir --mkdir=no --run=13:18 --tar
        
        This command will from the file transfer the files in the lines 13 to 18 contained in files.txt.
        Each line will be handled as a separate transfer and the data will be placed in a tar file. that
        tar file will then be transferred. On the remote machine the tar file will not be untarred. This
        you do have to do by loggin into the machine such as with ssh abd untar the file. T
