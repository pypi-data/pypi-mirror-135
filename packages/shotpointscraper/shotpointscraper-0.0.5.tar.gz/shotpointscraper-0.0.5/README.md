# Usage

   ID You can check the ID of the match in the URL section.(https://understat.com/match/ID)

 2.In the environment where shot_point_scraper is installed, execute the following command

     shotpointscraper
   ```
  3.You will be asked for your ID, so fill in the ID that you just checked.

 5.If you select csv or excel, you will be asked for a file name, please enter your file name of choice. (Do not enter the file format, as it will be added automatically.)
 The file will then be generated.

 6.If you choose "sql", you will be asked what format you would like the  shoot position information to be in.
   xy: Describe the chute coordinates using two columns, x and y.
   point: Write the chute coordinates in one column using commas and parentheses for x and y.

example:
 xy:
|  x  |  y  |
| ---- | ---- |
|  112.07  |  43.4  |
|  115.15  |  38.9  |

 point:
|  point  |
| ---- |
|  (112.07,43.4)  |
|  (115,15,38.9)  |
    
 7.You will be asked for the name of the file to be generated and the name of the database table to be filled in the sql file.
 The file will then be generated.

# Note
 
I don't test environments under Linux and Windows.

For the shoot position information, I use the statbomb type.(0<=x<=120,0<=y<=80)
