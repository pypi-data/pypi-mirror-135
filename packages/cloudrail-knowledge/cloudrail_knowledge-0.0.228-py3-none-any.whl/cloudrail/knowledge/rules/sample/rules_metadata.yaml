    description: Cloudrail will review the DocDB clusters being created in your environment.
      If a cluster is not set to encrypt at rest using a customer-managed CMK, Cloudrail
      will highlight it as a violation. This rule will only flag a violation for resources
      that are not yet created.
    human_readable_logic: Cloudrail will identify all DocumentDB clusters in the Terraform
      plan that are going to be created and are not configured to encrypt data at rest
      using a customer-managed CMK.
    console_remediation_steps: Follow the guide at <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/encryption-at-rest.html>
      to enable encryption at rest using a customer-managed CMK.
    iac_remediation_steps: For the aws_docdb_cluster resource, set the argument storage_encrypted
      to true and set the argument kms_key_id to use a customer-managed CMK ARN.
