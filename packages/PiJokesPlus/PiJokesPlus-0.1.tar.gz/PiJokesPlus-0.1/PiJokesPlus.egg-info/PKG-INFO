This Python library is a large collection of over 400 jokes from all over the Internet!
There are six main categories since the first release of the PiJokes+ library:
Christmas, Easter, Halloween, clever, funny and dad jokes.
There are a handful of basic functions you can use to access these functions which are all described on the PyPi website.

Please Note:
There are of course not an infinite amount of jokes in this library and it's certainly possible to retrieve the same joke twice in a row.
More jokes are always being added and the library is also being improved!
