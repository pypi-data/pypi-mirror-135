## Typing stubs for Pillow

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `Pillow` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `Pillow`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/Pillow. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `de5ec6a0d14351797a54b12b3910534b67df609e`.
